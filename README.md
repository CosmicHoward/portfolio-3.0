Once upon a time, I had a portfolio. Then everything changed when the 2020 attacked. At some point my hosting lapsed, I didn't backup for whatever reason, and four computers later I had no idea where the original source code for my portfolio wound up.

Everything is a learning opportunity though, so I took it as a sign that I needed to redo it anyway. Since then I've learned git, a couple of css frameworks and more juicy javascript stuff.

I've come a long way from my days on freecodecamp.
